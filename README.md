# powershell-prompts

This repository holds examples of how to create prompts inside the PowerShell console window.

## PromptMethod-Manual.ps1
This script holds an example function using what I call a "manual" method of creating a prompt, meaning more effort is put into creating help text and matching the color scheme of a regular PowerShell prompt.

## PromptMethod-dotNET.ps1
This script holds an example function using .NET Framework classes in order to create a prompt. The code is much cleaner and automatically includes logic for displaying help text and matching color schemes.
